# Claude Code Presentation: "From Code Monkeys to Code Orchestrators"

A compelling interactive presentation showcasing the transformative power of Claude Code through planning mode, specialized agents, hooks, slash commands, and CLAUDE.md context persistence.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Export to PDF
npm run export
```

## 🎯 Presentation Overview

This presentation tells the story of how Claude Code transforms developers from "code monkeys" doing repetitive tasks into "code orchestrators" who direct AI agents to build better software faster.

### Key Narrative Arc

1. **The Problem**: Developers spend 85% of time on non-creative tasks
2. **The Evolution**: Introduction of AI-powered development tools
3. **The Transformation**: Demonstrating 3-4x productivity improvements
4. **The Future**: Vision of developers as code conductors

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Framework**: Slidev with React components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom animations
- **Interactive Demos**: React components with real-time simulations
- **Theme**: Dark mode with construction site aesthetic

## 🎭 Interactive Components

### Planning Mode Visualizer
Shows step-by-step planning process with animated progress indicators.

### Agent Orchestrator
Simulates multiple specialized agents working in parallel on code improvements.

### Hook Flow
Demonstrates automated quality gates and error prevention.

### Command Palette
Interactive slash command execution with real-time output.

## 🔧 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Planning Mode
- Architectural thinking before coding
- Edge case anticipation
- Step-by-step implementation plans
- 90% faster execution with planning

### 2. CLAUDE.md Context Persistence
- Project knowledge retention across sessions
- Consistent coding standards enforcement
- Business rule awareness
- Team knowledge in AI form

### 3. Specialized Agents
- Security agent: OWASP compliance, vulnerability scanning
- Performance agent: Optimization, caching, N+1 query detection
- Architecture agent: Design patterns, separation of concerns
- Parallel execution for comprehensive code improvement

### 4. Hooks
- Pre-commit quality gates
- Pre-edit validation
- Post-task analysis
- Automated error prevention

### 5. Slash Commands
- `/test` - Run test suite
- `/plan` - Enter planning mode
- `/review` - Code review
- `/commit` - Smart commit
- Custom commands for team workflows

## 📊 Impact Metrics

- **Feature Implementation**: 4-6 hours → 30-45 minutes
- **Bug Discovery**: Production → Before commit
- **Test Coverage**: 40-60% → 90%+
- **Developer Productivity**: 8-10 tasks/week → 25-30 tasks/week
- **Code Quality**: 75% reduction in production bugs

## 🎪 Presentation Flow (30-40 minutes)

1. **Hook (5 min)**: The "Code Monkeys" problem
2. **Setup (5 min)**: Construction site analogy
