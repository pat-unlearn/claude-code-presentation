  Understanding Requirements
  Analyzing request: Interactive presentation for Unlearn.ai showcasing Claude Code
  - Target audience: Developers and technical decision makers
  - Goal: Transform perception from "coding" to "orchestrating"
  - Platform: Slidev for interactive web presentation
  - Branding: Unlearn.ai colors and professional aesthetic

  Context Analysis
  Found: Node.js environment, presentation context, need for interactivity
  - Framework: Slidev with Vue.js components for demos
  - Styling: TailwindCSS with custom Unlearn.ai brand colors
  - Interactive elements: Terminal simulations, live demos
  - Narrative: Construction site analogy throughout

  Architecture Design
  Planning component structure:
  1. Main slides.md with presentation flow
  2. Interactive Vue components for each major feature demo
  3. Custom styling with UnoCSS configuration
  4. Realistic data and terminal outputs for authenticity

  Risk Assessment
  Potential issues:
  - Component complexity affecting slide performance
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Animation timing and smooth transitions
  - Brand consistency with Unlearn.ai guidelines

  Implementation Strategy
  Breaking down into phases:
  1. Setup Slidev project with custom theme
  2. Create slide structure with 4-act narrative
  3. Build interactive components (PlanningMode, CLAUDE.md, MCP, Subagents, Hooks)
  4. Implement realistic terminal simulations and animations
  5. Polish styling and ensure responsive design

  Development Plan
  1. Initialize Slidev project with custom configuration
  2. Set up Unlearn.ai branding and color scheme
  3. Create main slide structure and navigation
  4. Build PlanningModeDemo component with step-by-step visualization
  5. Implement ClaudeMdEditor with file simulation
  6. Create McpServersDemo with realistic examples
  7. Build AgentDashboard with orchestrated execution flow
  8. Add HookFlow and CommandPalette components
  9. Fine-tune animations and responsive design
  10. Add speaker notes and polish presentation flow

  âœ¨ Ready to Execute - Time to orchestrate!
