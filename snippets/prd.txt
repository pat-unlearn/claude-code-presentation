  Requirements:

  Theme & Narrative:
  - Hook: "The Lonely Developer" problem - context loss, inefficiency, generic AI responses
  - Evolution story: From basic tools → Power tools → AI assistants → Full orchestration crew
  - Transformation: Developers become "Code Conductors" who orchestrate rather than type
  - Use construction site metaphors consistently (DIY → Power tools → Full renovation crew with project manager)

  Technical Implementation:
  - Slidev framework with Vue components for interactivity
  - Dark theme with Unlearn.ai brand colors (#2D4FFF primary blue)
  - TailwindCSS with custom animations and color schemes
  - Interactive Vue components with realistic terminal simulations

  Core Features to Demonstrate:

  1. Planning Mode
    - Interactive component showing strategic thinking before coding
    - Before/after comparison (4-6 hours → 1 hour)
    - Step-by-step analysis: Requirements → Architecture → Risks → Implementation
  2. CLAUDE.md Context Engineering
    - File editor component showing project DNA concept
    - Before/after examples (generic Flask → context-aware FastAPI)
    - Benefits: persistence, standards, business logic
  3. MCP Servers Extension System
    - Smartphone app store analogy for extending capabilities
    - Interactive demo with playwright-mcp and serena-mcp examples
    - Real browser automation and code analysis scenarios
  4. Specialized Subagents
    - Frontend, Backend, and Testing agents working in parallel
    - Orchestrator that plans then deploys specialized agents
    - Interactive terminal showing coordinated execution
  5. Hooks System
    - "Custom shell scripts for AI workflows" concept
    - 4 hook types: UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop
    - Quality gates and team policy enforcement
  6. Slash Commands
    - Power user toolkit demonstration
    - Built-in vs custom command examples
    - Interactive command palette simulation

  Visual Design:
  - Clean, developer-focused aesthetic with neon accents
  - Color scheme: Blue (#3B82F6), Purple (#8B5CF6), Green (#10B981) on dark backgrounds
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects throughout
  - Mobile-responsive considerations

  Content Standards:
  - Include specific metrics and research citations
  - Show real code examples in all demos
  - 4-act structure: Problem → Evolution → Transformation → Future
  - ROI-focused messaging with productivity multipliers

  Key Messages:
  - "Stop coding. Start orchestrating."
  - "The 10x developer myth becomes reality through AI teammates"
  - "Context is everything - AI without context is expensive autocomplete"

  Deliverables:
  - Interactive Slidev presentation with Vue components
  - All components should be self-contained with realistic simulations
  - PDF export capability for offline sharing
  - Speaker notes for presentation delivery
  - Getting started guide for audience

  Make every interaction feel authentic with realistic terminal outputs, proper loading states, and smooth animations that
  demonstrate the power of orchestrated AI development.
